    <ul>
      <li><strong>Know Your Soil:</strong> Perform soil tests to understand nutrient levels and pH balance; amend soil accordingly.</li>
      <li><strong>Choose Native Plants:</strong> Native species are better adapted to the local climate, requiring less maintenance and water.</li>
      <li><strong>Water Wisely:</strong> Water early in the morning or late in the evening to minimize evaporation and maximize absorption.</li>
      <li><strong>Mulch Regularly:</strong> Mulching retains soil moisture, suppresses weeds, and regulates soil temperature.</li>
      <li><strong>Prune Strategically:</strong> Remove dead or diseased branches to promote healthy growth and flowering.</li>
      <li><strong>Fertilize Appropriately:</strong> Follow recommended schedules and quantities to avoid overfeeding your plants.</li>
      <li><strong>Control Pests Naturally:</strong> Use beneficial insects, neem oil, or organic sprays to keep pests at bay without harmful chemicals.</li>
    </ul>
